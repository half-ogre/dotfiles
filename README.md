# Half-Ogre's Bootstrap & Dotfiles

This repo has the install script and dotfiles I use to bootstrap and configure my personal (Apple) development laptop.

## Warnings and Other Notes

- This only works with `zsh`
- This has only been tested on my personal MacBook Pro with an Apple chip

## The Goods

This is my kit (and what `./install` installs):

- Homebrew (duh)
- .NET
- 1Password
- Azure CLI
- Delta highlighter for Git
- Docker
- Fira Code Nerd Font
- Git
- GitHub CLI
- GitHub Desktop
- Go
- Microsoft Edge
- Slack
- Starship.rs
- Visual Studio Code
- Zoom

## How To Use This

This isn't really designed for others to use; it's for me. That said, if you want to try it:

- Clone the repo, `cd` into the clone path
- Change stuff that's specific to me (or needs to be specific to you), like in `.gitconfig`
- Run `./install`
- Manually do what you need to from [manual.md](./manual.md)
