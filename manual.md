# Manual Stuff

The stuff below are things I either can't automate or haven't yet spent the time to automate.

## System Preferences
- Uncheck `Scroll direction: Natural` in System Preferences > Trackpad > Scroll & Zoom, because it's anything but natural

## 1Password
- Sign in to 1Password account; (you have that Emergency Kit handy, right!?)
- Add browser extensions of choice

## Docker
- Launch Docker so it installs the `docker` CLI
- Give it privileged access when it prompts for it
- Adjust resources as needed

## dotnet
- Install the ef-core global tool
- Install the aspnet-code-generator global tool

## Finder
- Add all the extra folders to the sidebar

## Microsoft Edge
- Sign in with Microsoft account to sync data
- Make the 1Password extension visible
- Turn on vertical tabs as any civilized person would
- Make Edge the default browser, because it deserves that

## Slack
- Sign into workspaces (or, since you probably only use Slack for work, pretend to forget to)

## Terminal
- Import `/assets/drew-terminal-profile.terminal` into Terminal and make it the default (this assumes you have Fira Code Nerd Font installed)
