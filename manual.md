# Manual Stuff

The stuff below are things I either can't automate or haven't yet spent the time to automate.

## System Preferences
- Set `Show Previews` to `Never` in `Notifications`

## 1Password
- Sign in to 1Password account; (you have that Emergency Kit handy, right!?)
- Add browser extensions of choice

## Code
- Install C# Dev Kit extension
- Install Go extension
- Install MonoGame extension

## Docker
- Launch Docker so it installs the `docker` CLI
- Give it privileged access when it prompts for it
- Adjust resources as needed

## Finder
- Add all the extra folders to the sidebar

## Safari
- Disable AutoFill (Settings > AutoFill; uncheck `User names and passwords` and `Credit cards`)

## Slack
- Sign into workspaces (or, since you probably only use Slack for work, pretend to forget to)

## Tailscale
- Launch Tailscale and allow kernel extension if prompted (System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security)
- Sign in via Apple account
- Configure your network settings and exit nodes as needed

## Terminal
- Import `/assets/drew-terminal-profile.terminal` into Terminal and make it the default (this assumes you have Fira Code Nerd Font installed)
